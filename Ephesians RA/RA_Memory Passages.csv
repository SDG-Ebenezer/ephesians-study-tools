Colossians 1:15-16,"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him."
Genesis 1:1-5,"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day."
Isaiah 40:25-28,"To whom then will you compare me, that I should be like him? says the Holy One.Lift up your eyes on high and see: who created these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name; by the greatness of his might and because he is strong in power, not one is missing.Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, “My way is hidden from the Lord, and my right is disregarded by my God”?Have you not known? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable."
Genesis 1:26-28,"Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”"
Genesis 17:1-6,"When Abram was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless,that I may make my covenant between me and you, and may multiply you greatly.”Then Abram fell on his face. And God said to him,“Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations.No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make you into nations, and kings shall come from you."
Genesis 2:1-4,"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens."
Exodus 31:12-14,"And the Lord said to Moses,“You are to speak to the people of Israel and say, ‘Above all you shall keep my Sabbaths, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I, the Lord, sanctify you.You shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you. Everyone who profanes it shall be put to death. Whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people."
Genesis 2:21-25,"So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.Then the man said, “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.”Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed."
Deuteronomy 6:13-15,"It is the Lord your God you shall fear. Him you shall serve and by his name you shall swear.You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples who are around you—for the Lord your God in your midst is a jealous God—lest the anger of the Lord your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth."
Genesis 3:14-15,"The Lord God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”"
Psalm 68:18-20,"You ascended on high, leading a host of captives in your train and receiving gifts among men, even among the rebellious, that the Lord God may dwell there.Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears us up; God is our salvation. SelahOur God is a God of salvation, and to God, the Lord, belong deliverances from death."
Genesis 4:3-8,"In the course of time Cain brought to the Lord an offering of the fruit of the ground,and Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And the Lord had regard for Abel and his offering,but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell.The Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen?If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, and you must rule over it.”Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him."
Jeremiah 23:5-6,"“Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is the name by which he will be called: ‘The Lord is our righteousness.’"
Genesis 5:1-3,"This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God.Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were created.When Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth."
Psalm 90:1-4,"A Prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God.You return man to dust and say, “Return, O children of man!”For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night."
Genesis 9:8-11,"Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him,“Behold, I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you,and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark; it is for every beast of the earth.I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.”"
Exodus 31:15-18,"Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the Lord. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall be put to death.Therefore the people of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, observing the Sabbath throughout their generations, as a covenant forever.It is a sign forever between me and the people of Israel that in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.’”And he gave to Moses, when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God."
Exodus 32:6-14,"And they rose up early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.And the Lord said to Moses, “Go down, for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them. They have made for themselves a golden calf and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it and said, ‘These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!’”And the Lord said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them, in order that I may make a great nation of you.”But Moses implored the Lord his God and said, “O Lord, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent did he bring them out, to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth’? Turn from your burning anger and relent from this disaster against your people.Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.’”And the Lord relented from the disaster that he had spoken of bringing on his people."
Deuteronomy 1:29-32,"Then I said to you, ‘Do not be in dread or afraid of them.The Lord your God who goes before you will himself fight for you, just as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,and in the wilderness, where you have seen how the Lord your God carried you, as a man carries his son, all the way that you went until you came to this place.’Yet in spite of this word you did not believe the Lord your God,"
Deuteronomy 7:7-9,"It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the Lord set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples,but it is because the Lord loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the Lord has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.Know therefore that the Lord your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations,"
1 Samuel 12:20-25,"And Samuel said to the people, “Do not be afraid; you have done all this evil. Yet do not turn aside from following the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart.And do not turn aside after empty things that cannot profit or deliver, for they are empty.For the Lord will not forsake his people, for his great name's sake, because it has pleased the Lord to make you a people for himself.Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you, and I will instruct you in the good and the right way.Only fear the Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart. For consider what great things he has done for you.But if you still do wickedly, you shall be swept away, both you and your king.”"
1 Chronicles 16:4-19,"Then he appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the ark of the Lord, to invoke, to thank, and to praise the Lord, the God of Israel.Asaph was the chief, and second to him were Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, who were to play harps and lyres; Asaph was to sound the cymbals,and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.Then on that day David first appointed that thanksgiving be sung to the Lord by Asaph and his brothers.Oh give thanks to the Lord; call upon his name; make known his deeds among the peoples!Sing to him, sing praises to him; tell of all his wondrous works!Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice!Seek the Lord and his strength; seek his presence continually!Remember the wondrous works that he has done, his miracles and the judgments he uttered,O offspring of Israel his servant, children of Jacob, his chosen ones!He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth.Remember his covenant forever, the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan, as your portion for an inheritance.”When you were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it,"
Nehemiah 9:5-8,"Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, “Stand up and bless the Lord your God from everlasting to everlasting. Blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.“You are the Lord, you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them; and you preserve all of them; and the host of heaven worships you.You are the Lord, the God who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham.You found his heart faithful before you, and made with him the covenant to give to his offspring the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite. And you have kept your promise, for you are righteous."
Job 36:22-33,"Behold, God is exalted in his power; who is a teacher like him?Who has prescribed for him his way, or who can say, ‘You have done wrong’?“Remember to extol his work, of which men have sung.All mankind has looked on it; man beholds it from afar.Behold, God is great, and we know him not; the number of his years is unsearchable.For he draws up the drops of water; they distill his mist in rain,which the skies pour down and drop on mankind abundantly.Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, the thunderings of his pavilion?Behold, he scatters his lightning about him and covers the roots of the sea.For by these he judges peoples; he gives food in abundance.He covers his hands with the lightning and commands it to strike the mark.Its crashing declares his presence; the cattle also declare that he rises."
Job 40:15-24,"“Behold, Behemoth, which I made as I made you; he eats grass like an ox.Behold, his strength in his loins, and his power in the muscles of his belly.He makes his tail stiff like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together.His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like bars of iron.“He is the first of the works of God; let him who made him bring near his sword!For the mountains yield food for him where all the wild beasts play.Under the lotus plants he lies, in the shelter of the reeds and in the marsh.For his shade the lotus trees cover him; the willows of the brook surround him.Behold, if the river is turbulent he is not frightened; he is confident though Jordan rushes against his mouth.Can one take him by his eyes, or pierce his nose with a snare?"
Psalm 81:1-16,"To the choirmaster: according to The Gittith. Of Asaph. Sing aloud to God our strength; shout for joy to the God of Jacob!Raise a song; sound the tambourine, the sweet lyre with the harp.Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the full moon, on our feast day.For it is a statute for Israel, a rule of the God of Jacob.He made it a decree in Joseph when he went out over the land of Egypt. I hear a language I had not known:“I relieved your shoulder of the burden; your hands were freed from the basket.In distress you called, and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. SelahHear, O my people, while I admonish you! O Israel, if you would but listen to me!There shall be no strange god among you; you shall not bow down to a foreign god.I am the Lord your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.“But my people did not listen to my voice; Israel would not submit to me.So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts, to follow their own counsels.Oh, that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!I would soon subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes.Those who hate the Lord would cringe toward him, and their fate would last forever.But he would feed you with the finest of the wheat, and with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”"
Psalm 106:2-17,"Who can utter the mighty deeds of the Lord, or declare all his praise?Blessed are they who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times!Remember me, O Lord, when you show favor to your people; help me when you save them,that I may look upon the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance.Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have committed iniquity; we have done wickedness.Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider your wondrous works; they did not remember the abundance of your steadfast love, but rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make known his mighty power.He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry, and he led them through the deep as through a desert.So he saved them from the hand of the foe and redeemed them from the power of the enemy.And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left.Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert;he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them.When men in the camp were jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy one of the Lord,the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram."
Psalm 112:1-9,"Praise the Lord! Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who greatly delights in his commandments!His offspring will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever.Light dawns in the darkness for the upright; he is gracious, merciful, and righteous.It is well with the man who deals generously and lends; who conducts his affairs with justice.For the righteous will never be moved; he will be remembered forever.He is not afraid of bad news; his heart is firm, trusting in the Lord.His heart is steady; he will not be afraid, until he looks in triumph on his adversaries.He has distributed freely; he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; his horn is exalted in honor."
Isaiah 59:14-21,"Justice is turned back, and righteousness stands far away; for truth has stumbled in the public squares, and uprightness cannot enter.Truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. The Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no one to intercede; then his own arm brought him salvation, and his righteousness upheld him.He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and wrapped himself in zeal as a cloak.According to their deeds, so will he repay, wrath to his adversaries, repayment to his enemies; to the coastlands he will render repayment.So they shall fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come like a rushing stream, which the wind of the Lord drives.“And a Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who turn from transgression,” declares the Lord.“And as for me, this is my covenant with them,” says the Lord: “My Spirit that is upon you, and my words that I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouth of your offspring, or out of the mouth of your children's offspring,” says the Lord, “from this time forth and forevermore.”"
Nahum 1:3-8,"The Lord is slow to anger and great in power, and the Lord will by no means clear the guilty. His way is in whirlwind and storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.He rebukes the sea and makes it dry; he dries up all the rivers; Bashan and Carmel wither; the bloom of Lebanon withers.The mountains quake before him; the hills melt; the earth heaves before him, the world and all who dwell in it.Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the heat of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken into pieces by him.The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; he knows those who take refuge in him.But with an overflowing flood he will make a complete end of the adversaries, and will pursue his enemies into darkness."
Matthew 11:28-29,"Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."
Mark 10:5-10,"And Jesus said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife,and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two but one flesh.What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter."
Luke 12:22-40,"And he said to his disciples, “Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat, nor about your body, what you will put on.For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds!And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that, why are you anxious about the rest?Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.But if God so clothes the grass, which is alive in the field today, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith!And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, nor be worried.For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need them.Instead, seek his kingdom, and these things will be added to you.“Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.“Stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning,and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks.Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will dress himself for service and have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them.If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them awake, blessed are those servants!But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into.You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.”"
Luke 16:13,"No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.”"
John 10:4-16,"When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.”This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.So Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd."
John 16:5-17,"But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment:concerning sin, because they do not believe in me;concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer;concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.“I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.“A little while, and you will see me no longer; and again a little while, and you will see me.”So some of his disciples said to one another, “What is this that he says to us, ‘A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me’; and, ‘because I am going to the Father’?”"
Acts 20:15-36,"And sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chios; the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after that we went to Miletus.For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia, for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.Now from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him.And when they came to him, he said to them: “You yourselves know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day that I set foot in Asia,serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews;how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house,testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, constrained by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there,except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me.But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.And now, behold, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again.Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all,for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood.I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;and from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them.Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears.And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.I coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel.You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me.In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all."
Romans 10:8-14,"But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim);because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.”For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him.For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?"
1 Corinthians 12:18-31,"But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose.If all were a single member, where would the body be?As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it,that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues.Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?But earnestly desire the higher gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way."
2 Corinthians 11:13-33,"For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.I repeat, let no one think me foolish. But even if you do, accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.What I am saying with this boastful confidence, I say not as the Lord would but as a fool.Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.For you gladly bear with fools, being wise yourselves!For you bear it if someone makes slaves of you, or devours you, or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or strikes you in the face.To my shame, I must say, we were too weak for that! But whatever anyone else dares to boast of—I am speaking as a fool—I also dare to boast of that.Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they offspring of Abraham? So am I.Are they servants of Christ? I am a better one—I am talking like a madman—with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death.Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one.Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I was adrift at sea;on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers;in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure.And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches.Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant?If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.At Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to seize me,but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands."
Galatians 2:20-21,"I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose."
Ephesians 3:8-10,"To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things,so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places."
Colossians 1:24-29,"Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church,of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from God that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known,the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his saints.To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may present everyone mature in Christ.For this I toil, struggling with all his energy that he powerfully works within me."
Colossians 3:18-25,"Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them.Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged.Bondservants, obey in everything those who are your earthly masters, not by way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men,knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality."
1 Thessalonians 2:4-13,"but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please man, but to please God who tests our hearts.For we never came with words of flattery, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed—God is witness.Nor did we seek glory from people, whether from you or from others, though we could have made demands as apostles of Christ.But we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother taking care of her own children.So, being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves, because you had become very dear to us.For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil: we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and righteous and blameless was our conduct toward you believers.For you know how, like a father with his children,we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and charged you to walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers."
1 Timothy 6:3-9,"If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness,he is puffed up with conceit and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions,and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain.But godliness with contentment is great gain,for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world.But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction."
Titus 2:7-14,"Show yourself in all respects to be a model of good works, and in your teaching show integrity, dignity,and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us.Bondservants are to be submissive to their own masters in everything; they are to be well-pleasing, not argumentative,not pilfering, but showing all good faith, so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people,training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age,waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works."
1 Peter 2:18-20,"Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust.For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly.For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God."
Revelation 2:1-10,"“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: ‘The words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands.“‘I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false.I know you are enduring patiently and bearing up for my name's sake, and you have not grown weary.But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first.Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.Yet this you have: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.’“And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: ‘The words of the first and the last, who died and came to life.“‘I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich) and the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life."
Revelation 14:1-8,"Then I looked, and behold, on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.And I heard a voice from heaven like the roar of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder. The voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps,and they were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. No one could learn that song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. It is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been redeemed from mankind as firstfruits for God and the Lamb,and in their mouth no lie was found, for they are blameless.Then I saw another angel flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people.And he said with a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water.”Another angel, a second, followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who made all nations drink the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality.”"
Leviticus 25:24-28,"And in all the country you possess, you shall allow a redemption of the land.“If your brother becomes poor and sells part of his property, then his nearest redeemer shall come and redeem what his brother has sold.If a man has no one to redeem it and then himself becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it,let him calculate the years since he sold it and pay back the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and then return to his property.But if he does not have sufficient means to recover it, then what he sold shall remain in the hand of the buyer until the year of jubilee. In the jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to his property."
Numbers 28:1-10,"The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,“Command the people of Israel and say to them, ‘My offering, my food for my food offerings, my pleasing aroma, you shall be careful to offer to me at its appointed time.’And you shall say to them, This is the food offering that you shall offer to the Lord: two male lambs a year old without blemish, day by day, as a regular offering.The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight;also a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with a quarter of a hin of beaten oil.It is a regular burnt offering, which was ordained at Mount Sinai for a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the Lord.Its drink offering shall be a quarter of a hin for each lamb. In the Holy Place you shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to the Lord.The other lamb you shall offer at twilight. Like the grain offering of the morning, and like its drink offering, you shall offer it as a food offering, with a pleasing aroma to the Lord.“On the Sabbath day, two male lambs a year old without blemish, and two tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with oil, and its drink offering:this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, besides the regular burnt offering and its drink offering."
Deuteronomy 10:11-22,"And the Lord said to me, ‘Arise, go on your journey at the head of the people, so that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give them.’“And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul,and to keep the commandments and statutes of the Lord, which I am commanding you today for your good?Behold, to the Lord your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth with all that is in it.Yet the Lord set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them, you above all peoples, as you are this day.Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stubborn.For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe.He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing.Love the sojourner, therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.You shall fear the Lord your God. You shall serve him and hold fast to him, and by his name you shall swear.He is your praise. He is your God, who has done for you these great and terrifying things that your eyes have seen.Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons, and now the Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven."
1 Samuel 2:1-10,"And Hannah prayed and said, “My heart exults in the Lord; my horn is exalted in the Lord. My mouth derides my enemies, because I rejoice in your salvation.“There is none holy like the Lord: for there is none besides you; there is no rock like our God.Talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance come from your mouth; for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble bind on strength.Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger. The barren has borne seven, but she who has many children is forlorn.The Lord kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up.The Lord makes poor and makes rich; he brings low and he exalts.He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and on them he has set the world.“He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness, for not by might shall a man prevail.The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces; against them he will thunder in heaven. The Lord will judge the ends of the earth; he will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed.”"
2 Samuel 22:5-14,"“For the waves of death encompassed me, the torrents of destruction assailed me;the cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.“In my distress I called upon the Lord; to my God I called. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry came to his ears.“Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations of the heavens trembled and quaked, because he was angry.Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.He bowed the heavens and came down; thick darkness was under his feet.He rode on a cherub and flew; he was seen on the wings of the wind.He made darkness around him his canopy, thick clouds, a gathering of water.Out of the brightness before him coals of fire flamed forth.The Lord thundered from heaven, and the Most High uttered his voice."
2 Kings 6:8-17,"Once when the king of Syria was warring against Israel, he took counsel with his servants, saying, “At such and such a place shall be my camp.”But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, “Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are going down there.”And the king of Israel sent to the place about which the man of God told him. Thus he used to warn him, so that he saved himself there more than once or twice.And the mind of the king of Syria was greatly troubled because of this thing, and he called his servants and said to them, “Will you not show me who of us is for the king of Israel?”And one of his servants said, “None, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.”And he said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send and seize him.” It was told him, “Behold, he is in Dothan.”So he sent there horses and chariots and a great army, and they came by night and surrounded the city.When the servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was all around the city. And the servant said, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”He said, “Do not be afraid, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”Then Elisha prayed and said, “O Lord, please open his eyes that he may see.” So the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw, and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha."
2 Chronicles 20:2-17,"Some men came and told Jehoshaphat, “A great multitude is coming against you from Edom, from beyond the sea; and, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar” (that is, Engedi).Then Jehoshaphat was afraid and set his face to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.And Judah assembled to seek help from the Lord; from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord.And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, before the new court,and said, “O Lord, God of our fathers, are you not God in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. In your hand are power and might, so that none is able to withstand you.Did you not, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend?And they have lived in it and have built for you in it a sanctuary for your name, saying,‘If disaster comes upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house and before you—for your name is in this house—and cry out to you in our affliction, and you will hear and save.’And now behold, the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade when they came from the land of Egypt, and whom they avoided and did not destroy—behold, they reward us by coming to drive us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit.O our God, will you not execute judgment on them? For we are powerless against this great horde that is coming against us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you.”Meanwhile all Judah stood before the Lord, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly.And he said, “Listen, all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat: Thus says the Lord to you, ‘Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed at this great horde, for the battle is not yours but God's.Tomorrow go down against them. Behold, they will come up by the ascent of Ziz. You will find them at the end of the valley, east of the wilderness of Jeruel.You will not need to fight in this battle. Stand firm, hold your position, and see the salvation of the Lord on your behalf, O Judah and Jerusalem.’ Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed. Tomorrow go out against them, and the Lord will be with you.”"
Job 22:22-28,"Receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart.If you return to the Almighty you will be built up; if you remove injustice far from your tents,if you lay gold in the dust, and gold of Ophir among the stones of the torrent-bed,then the Almighty will be your gold and your precious silver.For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty and lift up your face to God.You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you, and you will pay your vows.You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways."
Job 28:1-28,"“Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold that they refine.Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from the ore.Man puts an end to darkness and searches out to the farthest limit the ore in gloom and deep darkness.He opens shafts in a valley away from where anyone lives; they are forgotten by travelers; they hang in the air, far away from mankind; they swing to and fro.As for the earth, out of it comes bread, but underneath it is turned up as by fire.Its stones are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold.“That path no bird of prey knows, and the falcon's eye has not seen it.The proud beasts have not trodden it; the lion has not passed over it.“Man puts his hand to the flinty rock and overturns mountains by the roots.He cuts out channels in the rocks, and his eye sees every precious thing.He dams up the streams so that they do not trickle, and the thing that is hidden he brings out to light.“But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?Man does not know its worth, and it is not found in the land of the living.The deep says, ‘It is not in me,’ and the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’It cannot be bought for gold, and silver cannot be weighed as its price.It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire.Gold and glass cannot equal it, nor can it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; the price of wisdom is above pearls.The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, nor can it be valued in pure gold.“From where, then, does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding?It is hidden from the eyes of all living and concealed from the birds of the air.Abaddon and Death say, ‘We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.’“God understands the way to it, and he knows its place.For he looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.When he gave to the wind its weight and apportioned the waters by measure,when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder,then he saw it and declared it; he established it, and searched it out.And he said to man, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.’”"
Job 38:1-33,"Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:“Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?Dress for action like a man; I will question you, and you make it known to me.“Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.Who determined its measurements—surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it?On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone,when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?“Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb,when I made clouds its garment and thick darkness its swaddling band,and prescribed limits for it and set bars and doors,and said, ‘Thus far shall you come, and no farther, and here shall your proud waves be stayed’?“Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place,that it might take hold of the skirts of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it?It is changed like clay under the seal, and its features stand out like a garment.From the wicked their light is withheld, and their uplifted arm is broken.“Have you entered into the springs of the sea, or walked in the recesses of the deep?Have the gates of death been revealed to you, or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?Have you comprehended the expanse of the earth? Declare, if you know all this.“Where is the way to the dwelling of light, and where is the place of darkness,that you may take it to its territory and that you may discern the paths to its home?You know, for you were born then, and the number of your days is great!“Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war?What is the way to the place where the light is distributed, or where the east wind is scattered upon the earth?“Who has cleft a channel for the torrents of rain and a way for the thunderbolt,to bring rain on a land where no man is, on the desert in which there is no man,to satisfy the waste and desolate land, and to make the ground sprout with grass?“Has the rain a father, or who has begotten the drops of dew?From whose womb did the ice come forth, and who has given birth to the frost of heaven?The waters become hard like stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.“Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loose the cords of Orion?Can you lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season, or can you guide the Bear with its children?Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you establish their rule on the earth?"
Psalm 89:5-18,"Let the heavens praise your wonders, O Lord, your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones!For who in the skies can be compared to the Lord? Who among the heavenly beings is like the Lord,a God greatly to be feared in the council of the holy ones, and awesome above all who are around him?O Lord God of hosts, who is mighty as you are, O Lord, with your faithfulness all around you?You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, you still them.You crushed Rahab like a carcass; you scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours; the world and all that is in it, you have founded them.The north and the south, you have created them; Tabor and Hermon joyously praise your name.You have a mighty arm; strong is your hand, high your right hand.Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; steadfast love and faithfulness go before you.Blessed are the people who know the festal shout, who walk, O Lord, in the light of your face,who exult in your name all the day and in your righteousness are exalted.For you are the glory of their strength; by your favor our horn is exalted.For our shield belongs to the Lord, our king to the Holy One of Israel."
Proverbs 12:1-28,"Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he who hates reproof is stupid.A good man obtains favor from the Lord, but a man of evil devices he condemns.No one is established by wickedness, but the root of the righteous will never be moved.An excellent wife is the crown of her husband, but she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones.The thoughts of the righteous are just; the counsels of the wicked are deceitful.The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood, but the mouth of the upright delivers them.The wicked are overthrown and are no more, but the house of the righteous will stand.A man is commended according to his good sense, but one of twisted mind is despised.Better to be lowly and have a servant than to play the great man and lack bread.Whoever is righteous has regard for the life of his beast, but the mercy of the wicked is cruel.Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless pursuits lacks sense.Whoever is wicked covets the spoil of evildoers, but the root of the righteous bears fruit.An evil man is ensnared by the transgression of his lips, but the righteous escapes from trouble.From the fruit of his mouth a man is satisfied with good, and the work of a man's hand comes back to him.The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice.The vexation of a fool is known at once, but the prudent ignores an insult.Whoever speaks the truth gives honest evidence, but a false witness utters deceit.There is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts, but the tongue of the wise brings healing.Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue is but for a moment.Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil, but those who plan peace have joy.No ill befalls the righteous, but the wicked are filled with trouble.Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but those who act faithfully are his delight.A prudent man conceals knowledge, but the heart of fools proclaims folly.The hand of the diligent will rule, while the slothful will be put to forced labor.Anxiety in a man's heart weighs him down, but a good word makes him glad.One who is righteous is a guide to his neighbor, but the way of the wicked leads them astray.Whoever is slothful will not roast his game, but the diligent man will get precious wealth.In the path of righteousness is life, and in its pathway there is no death."
Proverbs 24:1-27,"Be not envious of evil men, nor desire to be with them,for their hearts devise violence, and their lips talk of trouble.By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established;by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches.A wise man is full of strength, and a man of knowledge enhances his might,for by wise guidance you can wage your war, and in abundance of counselors there is victory.Wisdom is too high for a fool; in the gate he does not open his mouth.Whoever plans to do evil will be called a schemer.The devising of folly is sin, and the scoffer is an abomination to mankind.If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small.Rescue those who are being taken away to death; hold back those who are stumbling to the slaughter.If you say, “Behold, we did not know this,” does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who keeps watch over your soul know it, and will he not repay man according to his work?My son, eat honey, for it is good, and the drippings of the honeycomb are sweet to your taste.Know that wisdom is such to your soul; if you find it, there will be a future, and your hope will not be cut off.Lie not in wait as a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous; do no violence to his home;for the righteous falls seven times and rises again, but the wicked stumble in times of calamity.Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles,lest the Lord see it and be displeased, and turn away his anger from him.Fret not yourself because of evildoers, and be not envious of the wicked,for the evil man has no future; the lamp of the wicked will be put out.My son, fear the Lord and the king, and do not join with those who do otherwise,for disaster will arise suddenly from them, and who knows the ruin that will come from them both?These also are sayings of the wise. Partiality in judging is not good.Whoever says to the wicked, “You are in the right,” will be cursed by peoples, abhorred by nations,but those who rebuke the wicked will have delight, and a good blessing will come upon them.Whoever gives an honest answer kisses the lips.Prepare your work outside; get everything ready for yourself in the field, and after that build your house."
Ecclesiastes 7:7-19,"Surely oppression drives the wise into madness, and a bribe corrupts the heart.Better is the end of a thing than its beginning, and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.Be not quick in your spirit to become angry, for anger lodges in the heart of fools.Say not, “Why were the former days better than these?” For it is not from wisdom that you ask this.Wisdom is good with an inheritance, an advantage to those who see the sun.For the protection of wisdom is like the protection of money, and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.Consider the work of God: who can make straight what he has made crooked?In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider: God has made the one as well as the other, so that man may not find out anything that will be after him.In my vain life I have seen everything. There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his evildoing.Be not overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself?Be not overly wicked, neither be a fool. Why should you die before your time?It is good that you should take hold of this, and from that withhold not your hand, for the one who fears God shall come out from both of them.Wisdom gives strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city."
Isaiah 1:15-20,"When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes; cease to do evil,learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause.“Come now, let us reason together, says the Lord: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be eaten by the sword; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.”"
Isaiah 12:1-5,"You will say in that day: “I will give thanks to you, O Lord, for though you were angry with me, your anger turned away, that you might comfort me.“Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; for the Lord God is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation.”With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.And you will say in that day: “Give thanks to the Lord, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the peoples, proclaim that his name is exalted.“Sing praises to the Lord, for he has done gloriously; let this be made known in all the earth."
Isaiah 26:3-9,"You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you.Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord God is an everlasting rock.For he has humbled the inhabitants of the height, the lofty city. He lays it low, lays it low to the ground, casts it to the dust.The foot tramples it, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy.”The path of the righteous is level; you make level the way of the righteous.In the path of your judgments, O Lord, we wait for you; your name and remembrance are the desire of our soul.My soul yearns for you in the night; my spirit within me earnestly seeks you. For when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness."
Jeremiah 17:1-8,"“The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron; with a point of diamond it is engraved on the tablet of their heart, and on the horns of their altars,while their children remember their altars and their Asherim, beside every green tree and on the high hills,on the mountains in the open country. Your wealth and all your treasures I will give for spoil as the price of your high places for sin throughout all your territory.You shall loosen your hand from your heritage that I gave to you, and I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know, for in my anger a fire is kindled that shall burn forever.”Thus says the Lord: “Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength, whose heart turns away from the Lord.He is like a shrub in the desert, and shall not see any good come. He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness, in an uninhabited salt land.“Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, whose trust is the Lord.He is like a tree planted by water, that sends out its roots by the stream, and does not fear when heat comes, for its leaves remain green, and is not anxious in the year of drought, for it does not cease to bear fruit.”"
Jeremiah 35:1-14,"The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:“Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak with them and bring them to the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers; then offer them wine to drink.”So I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah and his brothers and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites.I brought them to the house of the Lord into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold.Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups, and I said to them, “Drink wine.”But they answered, “We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, ‘You shall not drink wine, neither you nor your sons forever.You shall not build a house; you shall not sow seed; you shall not plant or have a vineyard; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.’We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters,and not to build houses to dwell in. We have no vineyard or field or seed,but we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done all that Jonadab our father commanded us.But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‘Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Syrians.’ So we are living in Jerusalem.”Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:“Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction and listen to my words? declares the Lord.The command that Jonadab the son of Rechab gave to his sons, to drink no wine, has been kept, and they drink none to this day, for they have obeyed their father's command. I have spoken to you persistently, but you have not listened to me."
Hosea 2:14-23,"“Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her.And there I will give her her vineyards and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. And there she shall answer as in the days of her youth, as at the time when she came out of the land of Egypt.“And in that day, declares the Lord, you will call me ‘My Husband,’ and no longer will you call me ‘My Baal.’For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they shall be remembered by name no more.And I will make for them a covenant on that day with the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, and the creeping things of the ground. And I will abolish the bow, the sword, and war from the land, and I will make you lie down in safety.And I will betroth you to me forever. I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love and in mercy.I will betroth you to me in faithfulness. And you shall know the Lord.“And in that day I will answer, declares the Lord, I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth,and the earth shall answer the grain, the wine, and the oil, and they shall answer Jezreel,and I will sow her for myself in the land. And I will have mercy on No Mercy, and I will say to Not My People, ‘You are my people’; and he shall say, ‘You are my God.’”"
Obadiah 1:3-7,"The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rock, in your lofty dwelling, who say in your heart, “Who will bring me down to the ground?”Though you soar aloft like the eagle, though your nest is set among the stars, from there I will bring you down, declares the Lord.If thieves came to you, if plunderers came by night— how you have been destroyed!— would they not steal only enough for themselves? If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave gleanings?How Esau has been pillaged, his treasures sought out!All your allies have driven you to your border; those at peace with you have deceived you; they have prevailed against you; those who eat your bread have set a trap beneath you— you have no understanding."
Zephaniah 3:16-20,"On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: “Fear not, O Zion; let not your hands grow weak.The Lord your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by his love; he will exult over you with loud singing.I will gather those of you who mourn for the festival, so that you will no longer suffer reproach.Behold, at that time I will deal with all your oppressors. And I will save the lame and gather the outcast, and I will change their shame into praise and renown in all the earth.At that time I will bring you in, at the time when I gather you together; for I will make you renowned and praised among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes,” says the Lord."
Haggai 2:1-9,"In the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet:“Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to all the remnant of the people, and say,‘Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Is it not as nothing in your eyes?Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, declares the Lord. Be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land, declares the Lord. Work, for I am with you, declares the Lord of hosts,according to the covenant that I made with you when you came out of Egypt. My Spirit remains in your midst. Fear not.For thus says the Lord of hosts: Yet once more, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land.And I will shake all nations, so that the treasures of all nations shall come in, and I will fill this house with glory, says the Lord of hosts.The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, declares the Lord of hosts.The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, says the Lord of hosts. And in this place I will give peace, declares the Lord of hosts.’”"
Matthew 5:34-48,"But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God,or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.Let what you say be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything more than this comes from evil.“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
Matthew 19:3-8,"And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?”He answered, “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female,and said, ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’?So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”They said to him, “Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?”He said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so."
Matthew 28:1-20,"Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it.His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men.But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. See, I have told you.”So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.And behold, Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.”While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place.And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiersand said, “Tell people, ‘His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.’And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted.And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”"
Mark 3:11-19,"And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.”And he strictly ordered them not to make him known.And he went up on the mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him.And he appointed twelve (whom he also named apostles) so that they might be with him and he might send them out to preachand have authority to cast out demons.He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder);Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot,and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him."
Mark 16:1-12,"When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back—it was very large.And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed.And he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him.But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.”And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.[Some of the earliest manuscripts do not include 16:9–20.]  [[Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it.After these things he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country."
Luke 7:18-28,"The disciples of John reported all these things to him. And John,calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to the Lord, saying, “Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?”And when the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?’”In that hour he healed many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and on many who were blind he bestowed sight.And he answered them, “Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them.And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.”When John's messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are dressed in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' courts.What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.This is he of whom it is written, “‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’I tell you, among those born of women none is greater than John. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”"
Luke 10:38-42,"Now as they went on their way, Jesus entered a village. And a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house.And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching.But Martha was distracted with much serving. And she went up to him and said, “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me.”But the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,but one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her.”"
Acts 1:10-14,"And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes,and said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.”Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James.All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers."
Acts 17:22-31,"So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: “Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious.For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: ‘To the unknown god.’ What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man,nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything.And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place,that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us,for “‘In him we live and move and have our being’; as even some of your own poets have said, “‘For we are indeed his offspring.’Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.”"
Romans 8:1-11,"There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot.Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you."
Romans 13:9-14,"For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed.The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy.But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires."
2 Corinthians 1:3-7,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.For as we share abundantly in Christ's sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too.If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer.Our hope for you is unshaken, for we know that as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in our comfort."
2 Corinthians 8:1-22,"We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia,for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part.For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, of their own accord,begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints—and this, not as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us.Accordingly, we urged Titus that as he had started, so he should complete among you this act of grace.But as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in our love for you—see that you excel in this act of grace also.I say this not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of others that your love also is genuine.For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich.And in this matter I give my judgment: this benefits you, who a year ago started not only to do this work but also to desire to do it.So now finish doing it as well, so that your readiness in desiring it may be matched by your completing it out of what you have.For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have.For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened, but that as a matter of fairnessyour abundance at the present time should supply their need, so that their abundance may supply your need, that there may be fairness.As it is written, “Whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack.”But thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same earnest care I have for you.For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest he is going to you of his own accord.With him we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches for his preaching of the gospel.And not only that, but he has been appointed by the churches to travel with us as we carry out this act of grace that is being ministered by us, for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our good will.We take this course so that no one should blame us about this generous gift that is being administered by us,for we aim at what is honorable not only in the Lord's sight but also in the sight of man.And with them we are sending our brother whom we have often tested and found earnest in many matters, but who is now more earnest than ever because of his great confidence in you."
2 Corinthians 9:1-12,"Now it is superfluous for me to write to you about the ministry for the saints,for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year. And your zeal has stirred up most of them.But I am sending the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter, so that you may be ready, as I said you would be.Otherwise, if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready, we would be humiliated—to say nothing of you—for being so confident.So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the gift you have promised, so that it may be ready as a willing gift, not as an exaction.The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work.As it is written, “He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever.”He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness.You will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God.For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God."
Galatians 5:14-21,"For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality,idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God."
Ephesians 5:1-8,"Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children.And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints.Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving.For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.Therefore do not become partners with them;for at one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light"
Ephesians 6:4-10,"Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.Bondservants, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, with a sincere heart, as you would Christ,not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart,rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man,knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a bondservant or is free.Masters, do the same to them, and stop your threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that there is no partiality with him.Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might."
Philippians 2:12-18,"Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.Do all things without grumbling or disputing,that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me."
2 Thessalonians 3:1-15,"Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may speed ahead and be honored, as happened among you,and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men. For not all have faith.But the Lord is faithful. He will establish you and guard you against the evil one.And we have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will do the things that we command.May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ.Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from any brother who is walking in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us.For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not idle when we were with you,nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with toil and labor we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you.It was not because we do not have that right, but to give you in ourselves an example to imitate.For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.For we hear that some among you walk in idleness, not busy at work, but busybodies.Now such persons we command and encourage in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living.As for you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good.If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person, and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed.Do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother."
1 Timothy 3:2-16,"Therefore an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.He must manage his own household well, with all dignity keeping his children submissive,for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's church?He must not be a recent convert, or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil.Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace, into a snare of the devil.Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain.They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.And let them also be tested first; then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless.Their wives likewise must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober-minded, faithful in all things.Let deacons each be the husband of one wife, managing their children and their own households well.For those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these things to you so that,if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth.Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness: He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory."
2 Timothy 3:1-9,"But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty.For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good,treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people.For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions,always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth.Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith.But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men."
2 Timothy 4:8-15,"Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing.Do your best to come to me soon.For Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.Luke alone is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is very useful to me for ministry.Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, also the books, and above all the parchments.Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.Beware of him yourself, for he strongly opposed our message."
Titus 3:3-8,"For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another.But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared,he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit,whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.The saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works. These things are excellent and profitable for people."
Titus 3:9-15,"But avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels about the law, for they are unprofitable and worthless.As for a person who stirs up division, after warning him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him,knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned.When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.Do your best to speed Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way; see that they lack nothing.And let our people learn to devote themselves to good works, so as to help cases of urgent need, and not be unfruitful.All who are with me send greetings to you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all."
Hebrews 3:4-19,"(For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.)Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later,but Christ is faithful over God's house as a son. And we are his house, if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope.Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, “Today, if you hear his voice,do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness,where your fathers put me to the test and saw my works for forty years.Therefore I was provoked with that generation, and said, ‘They always go astray in their heart; they have not known my ways.’As I swore in my wrath, ‘They shall not enter my rest.’”Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God.But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end.As it is said, “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”For who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses?And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient?So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief."
Hebrews 12:18-29,"For you have not come to what may be touched, a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempestand the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further messages be spoken to them.For they could not endure the order that was given, “If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.”Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, “I tremble with fear.”But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering,and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.See that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven.At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.”This phrase, “Yet once more,” indicates the removal of things that are shaken—that is, things that have been made—in order that the things that cannot be shaken may remain.Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe,for our God is a consuming fire."
James 2:14-26,"What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food,and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that?So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless?Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar?You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works;and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was called a friend of God.You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead."
1 Peter 5:5-11,"Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you,casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world.And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen."
2 Peter 2:1-10,"But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of truth will be blasphemed.And in their greed they will exploit you with false words. Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment;if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;if by turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction, making them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly;and if he rescued righteous Lot, greatly distressed by the sensual conduct of the wicked(for as that righteous man lived among them day after day, he was tormenting his righteous soul over their lawless deeds that he saw and heard);then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment,and especially those who indulge in the lust of defiling passion and despise authority. Bold and willful, they do not tremble as they blaspheme the glorious ones,"
1 John 1:1-10,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we looked upon and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life—the life was made manifest, and we have seen it, and testify to it and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was made manifest to us—that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.And we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."
1 John 4:17-20,"By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world.There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love.We love because he first loved us.If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen."
Jude 1:3-21,"Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints.For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day—just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.Yet in like manner these people also, relying on their dreams, defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme the glorious ones.But when the archangel Michael, contending with the devil, was disputing about the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment, but said, “The Lord rebuke you.”But these people blaspheme all that they do not understand, and they are destroyed by all that they, like unreasoning animals, understand instinctively.Woe to them! For they walked in the way of Cain and abandoned themselves for the sake of gain to Balaam's error and perished in Korah's rebellion.These are hidden reefs at your love feasts, as they feast with you without fear, shepherds feeding themselves; waterless clouds, swept along by winds; fruitless trees in late autumn, twice dead, uprooted;wild waves of the sea, casting up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever.It was also about these that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, “Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones,to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”These are grumblers, malcontents, following their own sinful desires; they are loud-mouthed boasters, showing favoritism to gain advantage.But you must remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.They said to you, “In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions.”It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit.But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit,keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life."
Revelation 21:1-5,"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”And he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”"
